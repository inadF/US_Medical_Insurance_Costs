# US_Medical_Insurance_Costs

My first project. Leave suggestions to improve in building a project. How should I comment my code, it is clear enough for everybody, etc.

1. 'us-medical-insurance-costs.ipynb' is a Jupyter Notebook file with the actual project.
2. 'tasks.txt' contains the tasks for the project
